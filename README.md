## 📋 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the process of designing databases using:

- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**
- **Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EERDs)**
- **Relational Schemas**
- **SQL Implementation**

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to showcase best practices in database design, starting from conceptual modeling to logical structuring and implementing the design in SQL.

---

## 🎯 Project Contents

- **ERDs**: Visual representations of system entities and relationships.
- **EERDs**: Enhanced version of ERDs, including additional concepts like inheritance, aggregation, and more.
- **Relational Schemas**: Structured presentation of tables and their relationships within a relational database.
- **SQL Files**: Ready-to-run SQL scripts for implementing the database schema in a database system.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn how to analyze system requirements and translate them into an effective **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.
- Gain the ability to design **Relational Schemas** by converting ERDs into structured database tables and relationships.
- Enhance your skills in **database design** by applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects.
- Master using popular diagramming tools such as **Draw.io** and **ERDPlus** to create clear and visually engaging database designs.
- Understand how to implement the designs by writing SQL code to create the corresponding database schemas.
